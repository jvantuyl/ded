helvR12.pcf.gz is a copy of /usr/share/fonts/X11/75dpi/helvR12.pcf.gz
from Debian 5.0.

helvR12sm.bdf.gz is my modified version: I widened ']' by one pixel
and moved it one pixel to the right in order to fix the rendering of
"[]".  One can open this in 'fontforge' and save as TTF to re-create
helvR12sm.ttf in the 'resources' directory.
