TODOs for Diagram Editor
------------------------

Bugs:
- font rendering on OpenJDK

Small:
- right-click entity to set text color
- add control for dropdown
- checkboxes and radio buttons (simulations with entities look ugly)
- option to route edges from the center of the edge of the bounding
  box rather than from the center of the entity
- fix relation creation to not have the offset problem
- allow creating relations that are not bound to an entity but
  whose edge overlaps an entity
- rendering for relations with entities pointing to overlapping,
  perhaps container or containee, entities
- bidirectional relations with separate labels for each direction
- allow label on inheritance edge
- arrow keys to move; ctrl-arrow to resize; shift to not snap
- entity grouping
- better self-loop rendering
- specify initial size (etc.?) for new relations
- option to automatically expand entities to contain their title and attributes
- flag to turn off auto move/resize of window contents

Medium:
- allow editing multiple elements at the same time
- smarter relation routing
- undo/redo; mostly done; loose ends:
  - "redo a previous future"
  - check current diagram equals current undo record
  - show undo history dump in a window
- help bubbles

Big:
- implement font renderer to fix problems on certain JVMs
- add automated testing for the UI

Measuring effect of various "triple buffering" image types

Using test.ded, on 20th sample:
  normal: 810 FPS (no "triple" buffering)
  ARGB: 345 FPS
  RGB: 602 FPS
  compatible: 547 FPS (but was about to hit 600; think is same as RGB)
  USHORT_555_RGB: 142 FPS
