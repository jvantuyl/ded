TODOs for Diagram Editor
------------------------

Bugs:
- if use right-click to set entity shape to window, then
  try to resize, will assert fail because the center handle
  has not been created, and also the shape flags are wrong

Small:
- do not allow user to accidentally save ded as .png extension,
  since then can't load it
- add a shape corresponding to an edit control
- entity grouping
- better self-loop rendering
- dashed lines for relations
- specify initial size (etc.?) for new relations
- option to automatically expand entities to contain their title and attributes
- allow arbitrary fg/bg colors for UI mockups
- left-aligned titles of entities
- flag to turn off auto move/resize of window contents

Medium:
- smarter relation routing
- undo/redo
- help bubbles

Big:
- add entity shapes to allow mocking UIs
- add automated testing for the UI

Measuring effect of various "triple buffering" image types

Using test.ded, on 20th sample:
  normal: 810 FPS (no "triple" buffering)
  ARGB: 345 FPS
  RGB: 602 FPS
  compatible: 547 FPS (but was about to hit 600; think is same as RGB)
  USHORT_555_RGB: 142 FPS
