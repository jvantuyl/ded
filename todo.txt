TODOs for Diagram Editor
------------------------

Bugs:
- double-click on entity, but accidentally hit one of the resize
  handles: get error about it not being editable

Small:
- add image load log
- selected entities are now sometimes hard to recognize; expand sel rectangle by 1?
- copy+paste for sets of selected entities
- entity grouping
- better self-loop rendering
- two or zero arrowheads for relations
- choose relation line thickness
- dashed lines for relations
- specify initial size (etc.?) for new relations
- option to automatically expand entities to contain their title and attributes
- relation dialog should include owner checkbox

Medium:
- entities with hyperlinks, export HTML link map
- control over which entities are on top
- smarter relation routing
- undo/redo

Big:
- add entity shapes to allow mocking UIs
- add automated testing for the UI
