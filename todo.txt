TODOs for Diagram Editor
------------------------

Small:
- omit entity name if empty; just show attributes starting at top
- default cuboid depth should be 10
- add right-click menu for entities that allows picking
  shape and color and works when multiple are selected
- copy+paste for sets of selected entities
- entity grouping
- better self-loop rendering
- two or zero arrowheads for relations
- choose relation line thickness
- dashed lines for relations
- specify initial size (etc.?) for new relations
- option to automatically expand entities to contain their title and attributes
- relation dialog should include owner checkbox

Medium:
- entities with hyperlinks, export HTML link map
- control over which entities are on top
- smarter relation routing
- undo/redo

Big:
- add entity shapes to allow mocking UIs
