TODOs for Diagram Editor
------------------------

Small:
- bidirectional relations with separate labels for each direction
- allow label on inheritance edge
- arrow keys to move; ctrl-arrow to resize; shift to not snap
- entity grouping
- better self-loop rendering
- specify initial size (etc.?) for new relations
- option to automatically expand entities to contain their title and attributes
- left-aligned titles of entities
- flag to turn off auto move/resize of window contents

Medium:
- smarter relation routing
- undo/redo
- help bubbles

Big:
- add entity shapes to allow mocking UIs
- add automated testing for the UI

Measuring effect of various "triple buffering" image types

Using test.ded, on 20th sample:
  normal: 810 FPS (no "triple" buffering)
  ARGB: 345 FPS
  RGB: 602 FPS
  compatible: 547 FPS (but was about to hit 600; think is same as RGB)
  USHORT_555_RGB: 142 FPS
